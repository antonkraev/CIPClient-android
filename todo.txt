FINISH code:
- (void)imageTappedAR:(UIImage *)image
{
    [[self arInfoView] setHidden: YES];
    [[self arView] setHidden: NO];
    [[[self getAppDelegate] eventReporter] reportEvent:AR_TARGET_SELECTED withData:nil];
}

TODO:
1) most images have some semi-transparent drop shadow around them, it was not visible on iOS but visible on android. This might need to be fixed by Asya
2) AR view is temporarily disabled
3) no drinks list
4) need to decrease brands background alpha to 0.5
5) battery usage while AR is not visible
6) not tested on 800x480 - simulator doesn't work for me
